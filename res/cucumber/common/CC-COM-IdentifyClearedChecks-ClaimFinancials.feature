Feature: Claim Financials (CC-COM-IdentifyClearedChecks-ClaimFinancials)

  As an adjuster,
  I want to be able to process payments in ClaimCenter which have already been created.
  I want to be able to process payments:
  - Process Checks (modify, delete,Â  void, stop)
  - Process Payments (modify)
  So that I can verify the check/payment life cycle progression

  Background:
    Given I am a user with the "Adjuster" role
    And I have the "Toggle Auto APD Specialist Level 1" authority limit profile

  Scenario Outline: 1. Void a Check
    Given a Personal Auto claim
    And the claim has a "Collision" exposure
    And I set "3000 USD" available reserves for "Claim Cost" and "Material Damage"
    And a check payment exists against the reserve line
      | Cost Type   | Cost Category   | Amount   | Reserving Currency   | Payment Type   | Eroding   | Check Status   | Payment Status   |
      | <Cost Type> | <Cost Category> | <Amount> | <Reserving Currency> | <Payment Type> | <Eroding> | <Check Status> | <Payment Status> |
    When I void the check
    Then the check is "<Result Check Status>"
    Examples:
      | Cost Type  | Cost Category   | Amount  | Reserving Currency | Payment Type | Eroding | Check Status        | Payment Status | Result Check Status |
      | Claim Cost | Material Damage | 100 USD | USD                | Partial      | Yes     | Awaiting submission | Submitted      | Awaiting submission |
