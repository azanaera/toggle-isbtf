  Scenario: 1. Adding a note to an existing Personal Auto claim
    Given I am a user with the "Adjuster" role
    And a Personal Auto claim
    When I add a note to the existing claim
    Then a note should be on the claim

  Scenario: 2. Creating a new note on an existing claim
    Given I am a user with the "Adjuster" role
    And a Personal Auto claim
    And the claim has a bodily injury exposure
#    And I choose a third party to be the claimant for the vehicle exposure
    When I start creating a new note for "Medical"
    And Security Type is "Medical"
#    And the note is related to the claim (was exposure)
    And the note is confidential
    And I finish creating the note
    Then a note should be on the claim
    And a note has following details:
      | Create Date | Author | Topic   | Related To | Confidential |
      | Today       | Me     | Medical | Claim      | Yes          |
