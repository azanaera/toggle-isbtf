  As a customer service representative,
  I want to be able to search for an existing Personal Auto policy so that I can continue to capture loss details.

  Background:
    Given I am a user with the "Customer Service Associate" role

  # TODO ignoring S1 and SO2: Does this need a mock integration?
  # This file is identical to CC-COM-SearchForPolicy-Common, which has been removed from the code base

  Scenario: 1. Search for a PA policy to file claims against verified PA policies
    Given a Personal Auto policy
    When I search for a known policy by policy number
    Then I can lodge a claim against that policy
